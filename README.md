SAMWise+ Health Literacy Index Web Tool Prototype
===========


The goal of this prototype has been to work with subject matter experts to ultimately create a digital version of a Health Literacy Index (HLI). As an intermediate step to creating an HLI, a digital tool, Samwise+, has been created based on the Suitiablity Assessment of Materials (SAM) tool. SAMWise+ has the potential to be an important step forward, has it encourages individuals to use a scoring tool, other than readability formulas. One other core goal is to scan existing literature to identify which of the SAM criteria can be automated/digitized and if so, the level of effort necessary to automate the scoring.
